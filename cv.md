## Code examples
Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.
```
var squareSum = function (numbers) {
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum = sum + (numbers[i] * numbers[i]);
    }
return sum;
}
```
